- BUG: selection in histogram sometimes strange

- highlight both parents and subtree on hover
- highlight subtree using a rect around entire subtree
- better laid out label
- timeline axis
- animated expand/contract of subtrees

- window.history for histogram selection

- drill-down histograms

- use elasticsearch npm module

- show both latency and overhead in trace call stack

- basic throughput and response time charting (per service?)
